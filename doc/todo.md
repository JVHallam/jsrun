# To do
## Implementing the one day prototype:
* get a list of all exercises from a directory

* create the file that keeps track of the exercises
    * dump that list into this file, if not exist
* load the file from file, into memory?

* move the last exercise to the front
* select the first n exercises
* dump the new state back to the file
* return the first n exercises
