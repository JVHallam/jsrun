# To do
## Implementing the one day prototype:
* get a list of all exercises from a directory
* create the file that keeps track of the exercises
* load the file from file, into memory?
* move the last exercise to the front
* select the first n exercises
* dump the new state back to the file
* return the first n exercises

## Ready for exercises to be done:
* Get a list of the exercises to be done

* copy them to the exercise directory
    * check if the directory exists ( root/temp )
    * clear the directory out 
    * copy the new files over
